For my final project, I decided to create a website that celebrates horror culture. There are 12 pages of spooktacular media, featuring mock horror movie reviews, T.V. show reviews, video game reviews, a blog section covering various macabre topics, and grim historical figures. There is also a gallery section full of dark artistry from legendary artists like Salvador Dali, Vincent van Ghogh, and Francisco De Goya to Francis Bacon, and Henry Fuseli.

As part of my project, I programmed a Snake inspired clone with a quirky, retro, and stylistic, horror twist using JavaScript and HTML5 video and audio elements. I learned a little bit about JavaScript logic, and wanted to further improve my JavaScript skills and expand on DOM manipulation, Web API's, like local storage, intersection observer, functions, Object Oriented Programming, loops, and conditionals amongst other JavaScript facets by building a mini game and implementing background music and sound effects into it, triggered by conditionals, and lexical evironment in a function.

I had to install node.js to use NPM (node package manager) to install packages from its registries. I used dev dependencies such as node-sass, PostCSS autoprefixer,live-server, and npm-run-all so that I could set up a script in a package.json file that allows me to "watch" for SASS/CSS changes, and automatically refresh the viewport without having to do it manually by clicking reload. Autoprefixer add prefixes like -moz-, -webkit- to your properties, so you don't miss anything you might need.

I learned a lot about CSS, topics such as custom properties which made manages color and typography changes easier, CSS resets for a more custom layout, display values like Flexbox, Grid for easier layout than using floats and clears, keyframe animations, transform value-properties, and Web Design principals like Typography, and design heirarchy. I decided not to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, because I wanted to dig deeper into the core of CSS and see what I could produce. However, I did incorporate SASS because I wanted to nest my CSS class selectors as I don't think nesting is natively possible in CSS yet.

#### HTML folder:

In this folder I have a total of 12 pages. Starting with the homepage/indexpage, which features an introduction of myself and my website, and a preview layout of the various media I have comprised the site out of. There is a movie page where I review and rate horror movies I have watched, as well as a T.V. show and video page that pretty much has the same layout and intention.

There is a gallery page where I got to use JavaScript DOM manipulation methods like addEventListener functions to implement overlays upon clicking on an image, I used CSS properties like blur() function to add a gaussian blur to the background overlay of an image cented on the viewport.

I debated using Bootstrap to add a caroussel to the homepage, but I ultimately decided to created a caroussel using only JavaScript. It was a bit difficult, because it took me a while to come up with the JavaScript logic to make the caroussel slide the images properly using functions, forEach loops, and the DOM.

I utilized CSS properties like transform: translateY(), and overflow: hidden to manipulate and hide image overflow, and create a "slide" effect triggered by clicking bloody hand images on the left and right side of the caroussel container. My intention in going for this approach was to learn more about JavaScript instead of taking the more convienient route by using Bootstrap at this point of my learning journey.

I used CSS to style the layout of "Bloodworm", the "Snake" inspired clone with a goofy, horror, style twist. I used borders and inset feature in box-shadow property to style the game screen border frames. I gave the outer borders a groove style, and the inner border a dashed style that produced a "Beetjuice" style effect, which I liked very much. I used A.I. to generate a copyright free logo for the game screen, and CS50 duck image pulled from a google search to implement into the game.
