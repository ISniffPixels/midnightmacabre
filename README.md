For my final project, I decided to create a website that celebrates horror culture. There are 12 pages of spooktacular media, featuring mock horror movie reviews, T.V. show reviews, video game reviews, a blog section covering various macabre topics, and grim historical figures. There is also a gallery section full of dark artistry from legendary artists like Salvador Dali, Vincent van Ghogh, and Francisco De Goya to Francis Bacon, and Henry Fuseli.

As part of my project, I programmed a Snake inspired clone with a quirky, retro, and stylistic, horror twist using JavaScript. I learned a bit about programming, and wanted to further improve my JavaScript skills and expand on DOM manipulation, Web API's, like local storage, intersection observer usage, functions, loops, and conditionals amongst other JS facets by building a mini game.

I learned a lot about the CSS language, such as custom properties, CSS resets, display values like Flexbox, Grid layouts, keyframe animations, transform values, and Web Design principals like Typography, and design heirarchy. I decided not to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, because I wanted to dig deep into the core of CSS and see what I could produce stylistically.
