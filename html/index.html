            When I was a kid, I used to run to my bed as fast as I could, every
            time I turned the light switch off in my bedroom. Middle of the
            night trips to the restroom were even more terrifying. Balling up my
            tiny, shaky, fists, I expected the boogeyman to sweep me away into
            the darkness, never to be seen again. The first ever horror movie I
            recall watching was Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. I
            can't begin to count the amount of wide-eyed sleepless nights I had
            thanks to this iconic piece of film history. It baffled me how
            something so terrifying to me, could also be so mesmerizing, I
            couldn't stop watching. My life would eventually embark on a focused
            fascination with horror movies, and horror culture in general.
            Please, join me in celebrating horror by enjoying the content on
            this website. I hope you enjoy and are entertained by the dark,
            bloody, and creepy, just as much as I enjoy bringing it to you. Keep
            your eyes open, tread carefully, and may the fates have mercy on
            your soul....P.S. turn the lights on, if you're afraid of the dark....

              <h3>Featured Movie</h3>
              <p>
                1922 is based on a short story by Stephen King. It tells the
                story of a farmer who decides to murder his wife with the help of their manipulated teenage son, Henry, in order to keep her from selling her farmland to a pig farm and slaughterhouse company to start a business, and begin a new life in the city. The farmer, Wilfred, and his son must deal with the guilt
                of their actions as they try to cope day to day and try to resume their lives, while trying to deceive the law that is relentlessly investigating and looking into their horrific transgressions....<a

              <p>
                The first episode, “The Hour of the Wolf,” opens with a
                primitive human discovering that he can dream, and thereby
                escaping from the limitations of his world. As the centuries
                pass, humanity begins to lose its ability to dream, and all that
                remains of the Dreaming is Morpheus, the King of Dreams, who has
                been fighting a loosing battle against the forces of the
                Endless's enemy: the Drifter, who has been thinning out the
                Dreaming's borders. Following the death of Morpheus's human
                caretakers, he is captured by the Drifter, who is preparing to
                destroy him....<a

              <p>
                One of the most interesting aspects of Dying Light is the
                day/night cycles. During the day, you can explore the open world
                and scavenge supplies. You can explore the city looking for
                loot, side quests, and other activities. You can also use the
                day to strengthen your character by visiting the safe houses and
                upgrading your skills. During the day, the city is full of life.
                You'll see people going about their daily business, working at
                shops, and driving cars. But as the day turns to night, things
                change. The city falls into chaos as hordes of ravenous zombies
                emerge from the shadows....<a
